## 10/19/2025 - temperature detection, preparing for speech recognition  

### What Did

1. Installed Ubuntu 22.04 using a USB data cable
2. Connected a breadboard using GPIO, used the DHT11 on the board for temperature testing, and wrote the code in C++
3. Cloned the open-source project xiaozhi-esp32-server as a speech recognition server, and prepared to use xiaozhi-linux as the client
4. Previously, I tried using voke for speech recognition, but it failed
5. Attempted to deploy using Docker but failed because there is no arm64 image

### Next Steps

Complete the deployment of xiaozhi, and add temperature testing as an MCP

## 10/20/2025 - Complete speech recognition  

Completed the speech recognition module and discovered it includes built-in MCP support, integrated with Alibaba Cloud's QWEN model.  
Deployed Py-Xiaozhi and confirmed it can correctly recognize and respond (currently waiting for speakers to arrive, so audio playback is not yet available).  

## Next Steps:  
1. Add new MCP services to enable system control and resource monitoring capabilities for the voice assistant.  
2. Implement countdowns, timers, and alarm features.  
3. Add task scheduling functionality.  
4. Install a desktop environment for use as a set-top box.  
5. Incorporate router functionalities to act as a gateway for network proxy and ad-blocking.  
6. Set up a Minecraft server with integrated AI chat and control features.
